This is a mostly incoherent collection of tools and studies around the data about wine that I've been able to gather
from websites and publications. Despite its predicted incoherence, I'll try to explore the following matters:

1) What are the statistical relationships between the olfactory molecules extracted through tools like spectrometry
    from wine and grape variatels, and the overall aromatic perception of a wine?
2) How do people's tastes vary and evolve?
3) What is the role of climate on all this?
4) What do price tell us about the wine itself (if anything, really)?

I do realise all of these problems are fundamentally ill-posed, governed by a strong component of subjectivity and
probably impossible to explore with the public data that exists on wine matters, but anything coming out of this study
will definitely help me further my understanding of wine as a product and as experience and will be, most of all, great
fun.
